	steamgriddbCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("api-key", "k", "", "SteamGridDB API Key")
	steamgriddbCmd.MarkFlagRequired("api-key")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// steamgriddbCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
